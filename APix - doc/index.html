      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
      	Apix is a web application that highlights teamwork and mobility in a small simple package, to enable users to draw collaboratively on a single canvas. Its working enviroment is a web browser (desktop and mobile) and also enables a user to use his/her phone as a pointer for drawing on the canvas. Aditional functionalities regard import and export capabilities in different image formats.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
      	Similar applications, even though have a lot of drawing capabilities, they do not offer support for alternative pointing devices, like the phone inside your pocket!

      <h2>Application summary</h2>
      <p>
      	First, APix is a web based application where people can draw together on a web browser, on desktop or mobile, having multiple functionalities: to export their work as a GIF, PNG and SVG; to import a background image for the canvas from their device.
      	An unique point of view is that APix also offers support for android devices to be used as pointers for the drawing canvas, using only their motion to draw.
      </p>

      <p>
      	Being a web application means that we used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for the frontend.
      </p>
      <p>
      	On a android side we developed a simple application using a "hybrid" approach, meaning that we create the user interface using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, which are interpreted inside an <i>WebView</i> component of the Android OS. This application will allow the user to connect to a session by scanning a QR code generated by APIx. Besides, it will provide handy controls such as color choosing, uploading a photo directly from the android device and brush thickness.

      <h3> The workflow of the application</h3>
      <p>
      	For a new visitor things are pretty simple: as soon as you enter you can begin drawing and using all functionalities.
      	Regarding the drawing part, the user can draw freely using multiple colors and brush thicknesses and export their creation afterwards.
      	Adding a new member is a click away: pressing the  "Doodle with friends!" button, the user will get a shareable link for the current session, with which a newcomer can join!
      </p>
      	This list is a working progress and it grow over time, as the project does.

        <h2>Technologies</h2>
        <p>
	   		To create APix we will use <i>HTML5</i>, <i>CSS3</i> and <i>JavaScript</i> for the frontend part but also some Material Design icons and suggestions for a pleasant UI.

	   		We will decide later upon the technology to be used for the backend to better fit our needs.

	   		For the development process we will use <i>GitHub</i> to track down progress and fix bugs that may appear in later versions. For new features we will create new branches which, after finishing the implementation, will be added to the master branch.

        	<h3>Front-end</h3>

        	<h4>Main Page</h4>
        <p>
          The main page is simple and wants to offer simple and fast usage for all devices.
